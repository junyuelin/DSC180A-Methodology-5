3. The answers to the following four prompts, which are meant to help you brainstorm for your Quarter 2 Project Proposal, due on December 2nd. For each prompt, state the question that you’re answering in bold and write your answer immediately underneath on a new line. Make sure you’ve familarized yourself with the Quarter 2 Project Proposal specifications before proceeding!

- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is Nemo Guardrails, an open-source toolkit from NVIDIA that provides developers with powerful control over large language models (LLMs). It enables the creation of "guardrails" to enforce specific behaviors, ensuring models adhere to safety, topical relevance, and response formatting guidelines. By using simple YAML configurations and Colang language, developers can easily set up constraints to prevent harmful or off-topic responses, making LLMs more reliable for sensitive applications like customer support or healthcare. Nemo Guardrails also supports real-time monitoring and adjustments, allowing for rapid experimentation and fostering responsible AI development, which is crucial for deploying AI ethically and effectively.
- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For my Quarter 2 project, I plan to investigate the development of a mental health chatbot using a large language model (LLM) integrated with robust guardrails to ensure safe and supportive interactions. The focus will be on designing structured user flows, leveraging NVIDIA NeMo’s "flows" COLANG configuration, to address critical scenarios like emergency situations or sensitive topics. The chatbot will be able to recognize high-risk phrases and respond appropriately—for example, directing users to emergency services if they indicate immediate danger, rather than engaging in prolonged dialogue. This project aims to create a scalable, empathetic digital tool that offers mental health support while maintaining strict safety boundaries to prevent misuse.
- **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make to my current Quarter 1 project, which involves developing a translation app to translate English into Chinese with NeMo guardrails to filter out profanity, would be to expand the existing guardrail flows to provide more comprehensive protection against offensive language. This enhancement would involve adding more nuanced flows to detect and block a wider range of inappropriate content, ensuring more accurate and culturally sensitive translations. Additionally, I plan to implement a robust testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of these guardrails, using automated tests to verify that various edge cases and profanity scenarios are handled correctly. This approach will improve the app’s reliability and safety, making it more suitable for diverse users.
- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

For my Quarter 2 project, I am interested in exploring multimodal techniques to enhance the mental health chatbot by incorporating audio input in addition to text. This would involve using speech-to-text (STT) technology to allow users to interact with the chatbot through voice, making it more accessible and user-friendly, especially for those who may find it easier to speak rather than type. By integrating audio input, the chatbot could also analyze vocal cues such as tone and pitch using sentiment analysis on voice data to better understand the user's emotional state. This multimodal approach would enrich the user experience and provide more nuanced support in mental health conversations.
